An Internet Protocol Address (or IP address for short) is a numeric label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses have two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.

Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. However, due to the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP (IPv6), using 128 bits for IP addresses, was standardized in 1998. The deployment of IPv6 has been going on since the mid-2000s.
